= Maven OpenAPI Publisher

The purpose of this Publisher is to take in a single OpenApi document and

 - remove unnecessary schema elements
 - point to a folder where there is a `releases.json` file
 - write out the version of the API based on the `info.version` section
 - update the releases.json file to include this version.

The `releases.json` file looks like this:

----
{
  "latest": "1.1.9",
  "versions": ["1.1.5", "1.1.6","1.1.8", "1.1.9"]
  "published": ["1.1.5", "1.1.6","1.1.8", "1.1.9", "1.1.10"]
}
----

There are two goals, `reconcile` and `publish`
